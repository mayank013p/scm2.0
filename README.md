# Smart Contact Manager

A Spring Boot application designed to manage contacts. It features a simple user interface built with Thymeleaf, allowing users to view, add, and manage contact information.

## How It Works

- **Home Page**: Provides an overview and navigation.
- **Contact Management**: Add, edit, and delete contacts via a user-friendly interface.

The project structure includes:
- Java controllers to handle web requests.
- Thymeleaf templates for the frontend.
- Static resources like CSS for styling.

To run the application, clone the repository, build it using Maven or Gradle, and start the Spring Boot application. Access it locally at `http://localhost:8081`.
